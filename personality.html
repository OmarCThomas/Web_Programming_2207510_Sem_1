      <h2>My Top Three Personality Traits</h2>

      <article class="trait">
        <h3>1. Discipline</h3>
        <p>
          Discipline plays a major role in my academic success. As a Telecommunications Engineer and university student,
          I must balance professional duties with coursework and assignments. My disciplined nature helps me manage my time,
          meet deadlines, and remain consistent in studying even when work responsibilities increase.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="trait">
        <h3>2. Analytical Thinking</h3>
        <p>
          I naturally analyze problems before making decisions. This trait helps me significantly in subjects such as programming
          and database design. Instead of rushing through assignments, I break problems into smaller logical steps, which improves
          accuracy and reduces mistakes.
        </p>

      <article class="trait">
        <h3>3. Curiosity and Continuous Learning</h3>
        <p>
          I have a strong desire to constantly learn and improve myself. Curiosity pushes me to go beyond what is required in class,
          which strengthens my academic growth and prepares me for future technological advancements.

      <h2>My Hero and Favourite Quote</h2>
      <p>
        One of the individuals I admire most is Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX. He is known for pushing innovation in electric vehicles,
        renewable energy, and space exploration. His determination and long-term vision have transformed multiple industries.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This quote inspires me because it reflects resilience and courage. In both academic and professional life, challenges are inevitable.
        Persistence and belief in one's goals are essential for success.

      <h2>AI Business of 2025 Review</h2>

      <h3>Chosen Idea: AI Productivity Automation App</h3>

      <h3>Summary of the Idea</h3>
      <p>
        The AI Productivity Automation App uses artificial intelligence to organize tasks, automate repetitive workflows, schedule activities,
        and optimize time management. The app analyzes priorities and deadlines to suggest efficient work structures and reduce wasted time.
      </p>

      <h3>Application in My World</h3>
      <p>
        As a Telecommunications Engineer and university student, this type of AI application would improve my productivity by scheduling study time
        around work hours, prioritizing assignments based on deadlines, and reducing time spent on repetitive planning.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Concerns and Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        A major ethical concern is data privacy. Productivity apps can collect sensitive information such as schedules, emails, and work habits,
        creating risks if the data is misused or accessed without permission. Another concern is over-reliance on AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these concerns, strong encryption, transparent privacy policies, and user consent controls must be implemented.
        The app should support decision-making while keeping the user in control of final choices.
      </p>

      <h3>Example of an Existing App</h3>
      <p>
        Motion is an AI-powered task management and scheduling application:
